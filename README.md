# My Personal Portfolio Website ðŸš€

So whilst I have my [Web design business site](https://patrickalvarez.com/), I wanted to do a website for me as a full-stack developer. Usually, I take absolutely age coming up with a design but this time I wanted to just spend all of the time playing around with the code to figure it out. 

The design is copied from [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7) whilst I totally did all of the coding myself from scratch. Brittany, if you're reading this, you're design is ðŸ”¥.
